# framer-hook
A module for Framer that lets you easily hook a layer's property onto another object via spring or gravity.

The original use case was to layer a spring animation on top of an eased animation, to give more control over the timing and feel of a transition. Please see the spring example (hook-example-spring.framer) to get a better idea how the level of control it gives you.

I'm not a developer nor a mathematician, so much of this is improvised, particularly the physics. Please do let me know, or create a pull request, if you have any suggestions for improvements.

A more thorough documentation is included in the comments at the top of Hook.coffee.
